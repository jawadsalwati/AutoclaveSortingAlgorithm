This program requires connection to Quanser's 3D virtual arm simulator. 
The resulting code works to organize and sort randomly dropped boxes into their correct autoclave locations using a programmable robotic arm. 
The robotic arm is controlled by the flexion and extension of the user's arm, connected to an EMG.
This project was completed by Bela Davidson and Muhammad Jawad.
